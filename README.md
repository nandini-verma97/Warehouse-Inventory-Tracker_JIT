# 🏭 Warehouse Inventory Tracker (Event-Based System)

### 📋 Project Overview
The **Warehouse Inventory Tracker** is a Java-based console application that manages warehouse stock levels in real time.  
It allows users to **add products, receive shipments, fulfill orders**, and automatically triggers a **low-stock alert** when quantities drop below a defined threshold.  

This project demonstrates strong **Object-Oriented Design (OOP)**, the **Observer Pattern**, and clean, modular Java code.

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Add New Products** – Dynamically add new products with ID, name, quantity, and threshold.  
✅ **Search Products** – Find any product by ID.  
✅ **Receive Shipments** – Update stock when new items arrive.  
✅ **Fulfill Orders** – Reduce stock when customer orders are processed.  
✅ **Low Stock Alerts** – Notifies when stock drops below threshold.  
✅ **Validation** – Prevents invalid or negative input.  
✅ **Event-Driven Updates** – Uses the Observer Pattern for real-time alerts.

## 🧠 Core Concepts Demonstrated

| Concept | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **OOP (Encapsulation, Abstraction)** | Safe and modular design using getters/setters and classes. |
| **Collections (ArrayList, Iterator)** | Efficient in-memory product management. |
| **Observer Pattern** | `StockObserver` + `AlertService` for event-based alerts. |
| **Error Handling** | Graceful handling of invalid input and insufficient stock. |
| **Console Interface** | Menu-driven user interaction for simplicity. |

## 🏗️ Project Structure

edu.test/
│
├── Product.java # Represents a single product (ID, name, quantity, threshold)
├── StockObserver.java # Interface for stock alert observers
├── AlertService.java # Implements observer to trigger low-stock alerts
└── WareHouse.java # Main class handling menu-driven operations

## 💻 Example Workflow

**Step 1:** Add new product — `Laptop (Threshold = 5)`  
**Step 2:** Receive shipment — `10 units` → Total = 10  
**Step 3:** Fulfill order — `6 units` → Remaining = 4  

**Output:**

Fulfilled order: 6 units of Laptop (Remaining: 4)
Low stock for Laptop – only 4 left!
